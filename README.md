# Download images from GBIF files
Simple script to download images from [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org) darwin core files. This only works if the zip includes only one species, but it can easily be adapted.

Run as `python3 download.py <path-to-zip-file>`

You can uncomment like `106` to move zip file into the new species folder, this is left commented for demonstration purposes.
